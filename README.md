# Flood

A simple color based game. Fill the grid with a single color in as few clicks as possible.

<img src="img/sample.png" width="660" />

Click any square to flood that square's color from the top left, covering all connected squares of the same color.

Can you flood the grid in fewer than 40 clicks?
